# Training-Free, Label-Free, and Interpretable Visual Diagnostics for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)

This repository presents a fully automated, training-free, label-free, and interpretable visual diagnostic system for structural health monitoring (SHM). The system includes:

- **SOM-based crack region segmentation** using 9 visual-statistical features
- **Pseudo-label generation** to train CNNs without human annotation
- **Geometric alignment** for crack evolution tracking via KAZE + RANSAC
- **Thermal field mimicry** from RGB imagery (no IR sensor)

All components operate without manual labels, deep models, or parameter tuning, and can support robust SHM diagnostics in field conditions.
## 🌟 Highlights

- **Zero-Label SHM Pipeline**: No human annotations, no pretrained weights, no tuning.
- **SOM-Guided Vision Framework**: Clusters pixel-level features for interpretable segmentation.
- **Cross-Material Generalization**: One model segments cracks in concrete, brick, and shadowed surfaces—no domain-specific retraining.
- **CNN Pseudo-Labeling**: Auto-generates labels for CNNs, minimizing annotation costs.
- **Geometric Correction**: Unsupervised KAZE + RANSAC alignment enables crack evolution tracking.
- **Sensor-Free Thermal Proxy**: Pseudo-thermal degradation maps inferred from RGB images (no IR needed).
- **Open-Source, Deployable**: Lightweight, interpretable, and adaptable to field constraints.

> Designed for real-world SHM needs: explainability, zero annotation, deployment readiness.

## 🔍 Visual Summary: Generalization & Pseudo-Labeling via SOM

![Crack Diagnostic Generalization](./figures/cnnsom.png)

**Figure: Robust crack diagnostics across diverse substrates using our SOM-guided framework.**  
Top: Concrete cracks; Bottom: Brick cracks.  

Our method demonstrates strong **cross-domain generalization** powered by **unsupervised feature clustering**, achieving accurate segmentation without labor-intensive, domain-specific training.  
It also enables efficient **pseudo-labeling** for CNN models, significantly reducing annotation costs in complex, multi-crack scenarios.

## 🌐 System-Level Vision: Crowdsourced Smart City SHM

To extend this work toward scalable urban deployment, I propose a vision for **crowdsourced, sensor-free SHM** leveraging public vehicles as mobile sensing agents.

📌 Key ideas:
- Vehicles act as roaming data collectors via dashcams, accelerometers, and GPS.
- Visual/audio signals are uploaded through a mobile app, receiving rewards (ads, coupons) for contributions.
- Structural anomalies are identified using SOM-based diagnostics without requiring dense sensor networks.
- Aggregated data can support city-scale infrastructure monitoring at low cost.

This system complements existing fiber-based or edge-sensor SHM frameworks, offering **a lightweight, decentralized alternative** for urban resilience monitoring.
